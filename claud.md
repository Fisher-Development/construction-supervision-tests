### Stage 1: Planning and Working on Feature Document

Agent should find or create a new feature document in the docs folder.
One document per action. Each action can contain different handlers.

Document name format: `{name}_action`

Write requirements, implementation plan and discuss it with the user to make it optimal. Agent MUST NOT EDIT OR WRITE code files. Agent can write or update ONLY the feature document.

Agent should write collected data using SHORT, UNDERSTANDABLE style.
IF feature document already exists - agent MUST edit it with newly appeared requirements.

Ask USER for APPROVAL or change request after each iteration.

Continue to next step ONLY AFTER EXPLICIT APPROVAL. NO EXCEPTIONS.
